**Statement:** "This problem plays out on a graph where a “virus” moves from nodes to nodes, looking for an exit. There are several exits and you have to cut access to these exits by finding the best link to cut each turn, from the limited amount of cutable links. You will manage complex data structure like a tree where all nodes can store a graph."
