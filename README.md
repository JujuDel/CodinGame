## What is in this repo?

This repo contains some of my solutions for the [puzzles](https://github.com/JujuDel/CodinGame/tree/master/Puzzles) and some of my codes for the [contests](https://github.com/JujuDel/CodinGame/tree/master/Contest).

## What is CodinGame?

[**Codingame**](https://www.codingame.com) is an online platform for developers, allowing them to play with programming with increasingly difficult puzzles, to learn to code better with an online programming application supporting twenty-five programming languages, and to compete in multiplayer programming contests involving timed artificial intelligence, or code golf challenges.

It includes:

* [**Puzzles**](https://www.codingame.com/training) - **_Ordered_** by difficulty and **_labelled_** with the concept you may need to solve them

* [**Code golf**](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/codegolf) - **_Solve puzzles_** with the shortest possible code

* [**Bot programming**](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming) - **_Compete_** in multiplayers programming contests involing artificial intelligence. You can improve your solution at anytime

* [**Contest**](https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished) - **_Compete_** **_timed_** in multiplayers programming contests involing artificial intelligence. Once finished, the contest goes into the Bot programming section

* [**Optimization**](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization) - Try to reach the **_best possible score_**, you'll get a ranking and you can improve your solution at anytime

* [**Clash of codes**](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode) - Participate to a 15min **_coding battle_** !
